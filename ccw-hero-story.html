                    ‚Äî the unmistakable crash of his back door being kicked in.

                    "My wife grabbed our baby and ran to the closet. I could hear at least three voices 
                    downstairs," recalls the 34-year-old Iraq War veteran. "They were laughing, saying 
                    they were going to 'clean this place out.'"
